# Scala Data Processing Notebook
Scala code for reading and writing data using Spark

This notebook demonstrates various data processing operations using Scala in Apache Spark on Databricks platform.

1. Import the Notebook to Databricks
  - Log in to your Databricks workspace.
  - Navigate to the workspace where you want to import the notebook.
  - Click on the "Workspace" tab in the sidebar.
  - Select the desired folder or create a new one.
  - Click on the "Import" button and choose the option to import the notebook file (example_notebook.dbc) from your local machine.
2. Attach a Cluster
  - Before running the notebook, make sure you have a Databricks cluster attached. If not, follow these steps:
  - In the left sidebar, click on "Clusters."
  - Click on the "Create Cluster" button.
  - Configure your cluster according to your requirements.
  - Click on "Create Cluster."
3. Open and Run the Notebook
  - Once the notebook is imported, open it by clicking on its name in the workspace.
  - If needed, click on "Attach" to attach the notebook to your cluster.
  - Follow the instructions provided in the notebook cells for running each section of the code.
  - Execute the cells by selecting them and clicking on the "Run" button.
4. Review the Results
  - After running the notebook, review the results generated by each cell. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different configurations according to your needs.

What to expect:

1. Execution of shell commands to display the current location, list of files, and date.
2. Creation of a DataFrame containing data and saving it in Delta format at the specified path.
3. Reading data from Delta table and CSV data into Spark DataFrames, followed by displaying them.
4. Execution of a SQL query on the data to select records where the name contains fewer than 5 characters, and then displaying the results.
